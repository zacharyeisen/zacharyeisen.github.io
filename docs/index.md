 BIO:
   My name is Zachary Eisen and I am currently enrolled in 
   the Professional Certificate Program in Coding with MERN.
   This is my first introduction into the world of coding. 
   I come from a background in the Army, where I was a Military Policeman.
   I am a Disabled Vet. I also have a background in the funeral industry.
   I hope to make a career change into an entry position in the tech industry.
